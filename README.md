Hotel Booking and Spa Reservation System
This project is a Python-based application designed to manage hotel bookings and spa reservations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system allows users to book hotels, validate credit card information, and optionally book spa packages.

Features
Hotel Booking: Users can select a hotel by its ID, check its availability, and book it.

Credit Card Validation: The system validates credit card details and authenticates the user with a password.

Spa Reservation: After booking a hotel, users can opt to book a spa package.

Data Management: The system uses CSV files to store and manage hotel, credit card, and security data.
